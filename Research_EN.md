# Research Protocol: MCL Fabrication & Validation


### 1. Preparation Phase (Biomass)
* **Substrate:** Sterilized wheat straw or beech wood chips.
* **Inoculation:** Inoculate with pure culture of *Pleurotus ostreatus*.
* **Graphene Doping:** During colonization (Day 7), add 0.5 wt% CVD-Graphene nanoplatelets in aqueous suspension.
* **Inactivation:** Once the matrix is fully colonized, heat-treat at 100 °C for 120 minutes (deactivation of biological growth).

### 2. Functionalization (Infiltration)
* **Preparation:** Dry the matrix at 50 °C until weight remains constant.
* **Vacuum Infiltration:**
    1. Place sample in the infiltration chamber.
    2. Evacuate to $10^{-2}$ mbar.
    3. Introduce liquid EGaIn (Gallium-Indium Eutectic).
    4. Re-pressurize to atmospheric pressure to force the metal into the capillary network.

### 3. Safety Precautions
* **Chemical:** EGaIn is corrosive to Aluminum. Contact with Aluminum structural components of the Master Architecture is strictly prohibited.
* **Thermal:** Maximum operating temperature of the organic matrix is 250 °C (300 °C peak with BNNT protection).
* **Handling:** Use gloves when handling gallium alloys to prevent skin irritation.

### 4. Validation Metrics (Quality Control)
* **Electrical:** Measure continuity and resistance at 0%, 100%, and 300% strain.
* **Thermal:** Determine thermal conductivity using Laser Flash Analysis (LFA).
* **Morphological:** SEM imaging to verify the capillary filling rate.
